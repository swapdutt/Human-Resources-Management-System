# Human Resources Management System (HRMS) Application built using SpringBoot and Spring Cloud
### Contributor : Swapnadeep Dutta


###### Currently, the project is in development stage.

## Introduction:
This is a HRMS module for ERP system. The module provides opportunities for HR department to manage employees and job-related openings in the organization, such as view the list of all employee, search the job applicant by its id, make changes to the job posted on the organization's portal, managing the payroll of the employee.
The system is primarily designed to properly organize the work of the department, speed up processes of hiring employees or opening necessary vacancies for the organization etc.
In this project, only the back-end of the system is going to be implemented, although the front-end was included while designing of entire system.
